  abstract = {Let X be a projective variety which is algebraic Lang hyperbolic. We show that Lang's conjecture holds (one direction only): X and all its subvarieties are of general type and the canonical divisor K\_X is ample at smooth points and Kawamata log terminal points of X, provided that K\_X is Q-Cartier, no Calabi-Yau variety is algebraic Lang hyperbolic and a weak abundance conjecture holds.},
